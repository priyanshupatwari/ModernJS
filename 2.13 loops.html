  /*Output even numbers in the loop
  importance: 5
  Use the for loop to output even numbers from 2 to 10.*/
  // for (let i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
  //   if ((i % 2) == 0) {
  //     alert(i)
  //   }
  // }

  /*Repeat until the input is correct
    importance: 5
    Write a loop which prompts for a number greater than 100. If the visitor enters another number – ask them to input again.
    The loop must ask for a number until either the visitor enters a number greater than 100 or cancels the input/enters an empty line.
    Here we can assume that the visitor only inputs numbers. There’s no need to implement a special handling for a non-numeric input in this task.*/
  // let number;
  // while (true) {
  //   number = prompt("Enter a number greater than 100", 0)
  //   if (number > 100) {
  //     alert("Ok your number is greater than 100")
  //     break;
  //   } else if (number === null || number === "") {
  //     break;
  //   }
  // }

  /*Output prime numbers
  importance: 3
  An integer number greater than 1 is called a prime if it cannot be divided without a remainder by anything except 1 and itself.
  In other words, n > 1 is a prime if it can’t be evenly divided by anything except 1 and n.
  For example, 5 is a prime, because it cannot be divided without a remainder by 2, 3 and 4.
  Write the code which outputs prime numbers in the interval from 2 to n.
  For n = 10 the result will be 2,3,5,7.*/
  let numArray = [];
  NextPrimeNumber:
  for (let i = 2; i < 10; i++) {
    for (let j = 2; j < i; j++) {
      if (i % j == 0) {
        continue NextPrimeNumber; 
        // says goto outer loop below line "NextPrimeNumber"
        // code execution jumps to the next iteration of the labeled loop.E
      }
    }
    numArray.push(i);
  }
  alert(numArray);
